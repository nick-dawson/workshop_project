When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library("dplyr")
```

Read in the data and subset it.

```{r, read-and-subset-data}
gap.in = read.table("output/combined_gapMinder.tsv",sep = "\t",header = TRUE)


p1 = subset(gap.in,gap.in$country == "Chad")
p2 = subset(gap.in,gap.in$country == "France")
p3 = subset(gap.in,gap.in$country == "Finland")

```

Now plot the data.

```{r}
